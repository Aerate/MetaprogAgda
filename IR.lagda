%if False
\begin{code}
module IR where

open import Vec public
open import Normal public

Recall that |Fin n| is an enumeration of |n| elements. We might
consider how to take these enumerations as the atomic components of a
dependent type system, closed under $\Sigma$- and $\Pi$-types. Finite
sums and products of finite things are finite, so we can compute their
sizes.

%format sum = "\F{sum}"
%format prod = "\F{prod}"
\begin{code}
sum prod : (n : Nat) -> (Fin n -> Nat) -> Nat
sum   zero     _  = 0
sum   (suc n)  f  = f zero +Nat sum n (f o suc)
prod  zero     _  = 1
prod  (suc n)  f  = f zero *Nat sum n (f o suc)
\end{code}

But can we write down a precise datatype ofthe type expressions in our
finitary system?

%format FTy = "\D{FTy}"
%format fin = "\C{fin}"
\begin{spec}
data FTy : Set where
  fin    : Nat -> FTy
  sg pi  : (S : FTy)(T : Fin ? -> FTy) -> FTy
\end{spec}

I was not quite able to finish the definition, because I could not give the
domain of |T|. Intutively, when we take sums or products over a domain, we
should have one summand or factor for each element of that domain. But we have
only |S|, the expressions which \emph{stands for} the domain. We know that it
is bound to be finite, so I have filled in |Fin ?|, but to make further progress,
we need to know the \emph{size} of |S|. Intuitively, it is easy to compute the
size of an |FTy|: the base case is direct; the structural cases are captured
by |sum| and |prod|. The trouble is that we cannot wait until after dclaring
|FTy| to define the size, because we need size information, right there at that
|?|. What can we do?

%format # = "\F{\#}"
One thing that Agda lets us do is just the thing we need. We can define
|FTy| and its size function, |#|, \emph{simultaneously}.

\begin{code}
mutual

  data FTy : Set where
    fin    : Nat -> FTy
    sg pi  : (S : FTy)(T : Fin (# S) -> FTy) -> FTy

  # : FTy -> Nat
  # (fin n)   = n
  # (sg S T)  = sum   (# S) \ s -> # (T s)
  # (pi S T)  = prod  (# S) \ s -> # (T s)
\end{code}

For example, if we define the forgetful map from |Fin| back to |Nat|,
%format fog = "\F{fog}"
\begin{code}
fog : forall {n} -> Fin n -> Nat
fog zero     = zero
fog (suc i)  = suc (fog i)
\end{code}
we can\nudge{in honour of Gauss} check that
\[
  |# (sg (fin 101) \ s -> fin (fog s)) = 5050|
\]

We have just seen our first example of
\emph{induction-recursion}. Where an inductive definition tells us how
to perform construction of data incrementally, induction-recursion
tells us how to perform construction-\emph{with-interpretation}
incrementally. Together, |(FTy , #) : Fam Nat|, with the interpretation
just telling us sizes, so that |Fin o #| gives an unstructured representation
of a given |FTy| type. If we wanted a structured representation, we
could just as well have interpreted |FTy| in |Set|.

%format FTy' = FTy
%format FEl = "\F{FEl}"
\begin{code}
mutual

  data FTy' : Set where
    fin    : Nat -> FTy'
    sg pi  : (S : FTy')(T : FEl S -> FTy') -> FTy'

  FEl : FTy' -> Set
  FEl (fin n)   = Fin n
  FEl (sg S T)  = Sg  (FEl S) \ s -> FEl (T s)
  FEl (pi S T)  = (s : FEl S) -> FEl (T s)
\end{code}

Now, what has happened? We have |(FTy' , FEl) : Fam Set|, picking out a
subset of |Set| by choosing names for them in |FTy|. But |FTy| is small
enough to be a |Set| itself! IR is the Incredible Ray that shrinks large
sets to small encodings of subsets of them.


\section{Records}

Randy Pollack identified the task of modelling \emph{record} types as a
key early use of induction-recursion, motivated to organise libraries for
mathematical structure.

It doesn't take IR to have a go at modelling records, just something a
bit like |Desc|, but just describing the right-nested |Sg|-types.

%format RecR = "\D{RecR}"
%format !>RR = !> "_{\!\F{RR}}"
%format <!_!>RR = <! _ !>RR
\begin{code}
data RecR : Set1 where
  <>   : RecR
  _,_  : (A : Set)(R : A -> RecR) -> RecR

<!_!>RR : RecR -> Set
<! <> !>RR     = One
<! A , R !>RR  = Sg A \ a -> <! R a !>RR
\end{code}

That gives us a very flexible, variant notion of record, where the
values of earlier fields can determine the entire structure of the rest
of the record. Sometimes, however, it may be too flexible: you cannot
tell from a |RecR| description how many fields a record has---indeed, this
quantity may vary from record to record. You can, of course, count the fields
in an actual record, then define projection. You do it.

\begin{exe}[projection from |RecR|]
Show how to compute the size of a record, then define the projections,
first of types, then of values.
%format sizeRR = "\F{sizeRR}"
%format TyRR = "\F{TyRR}"
%format vaRR = "\F{vaRR}"
\begin{spec}
sizeRR : (R : RecR) -> <! R !>RR -> Nat
sizeRR R r = ?

TyRR : (R : RecR)(r : <! R !>RR) -> Fin (sizeRR R r) -> Set
TyRR R r i = ?

vaRR : (R : RecR)(r : <! R !>RR)(i : Fin (sizeRR R r)) -> TyRR R r i
vaRR R r i = ?
\end{spec}
%if False
\begin{code}
sizeRR : (R : RecR) -> <! R !>RR -> Nat
sizeRR <>       _        = zero
sizeRR (A , R)  (a , r)  = suc (sizeRR (R a) r)

TyRR : (R : RecR)(r : <! R !>RR) -> Fin (sizeRR R r) -> Set
TyRR <>       _        ()
TyRR (A , R)  (a , r)  zero     = A
TyRR (A , R)  (a , r)  (suc i)  = TyRR (R a) r i

vaRR : (R : RecR)(r : <! R !>RR)(i : Fin (sizeRR R r)) -> TyRR R r i
vaRR <>       _        ()
vaRR (A , R)  (a , r)  zero     = a
vaRR (A , R)  (a , r)  (suc i)  = vaRR (R a) r i
\end{code}
%endif
\end{exe}

Of course, we could enforce uniformity of length by indexing.
But a bigger problem with |RecR| is that, being right-nested, our access
to it is left-anchored. Extending a record with more fields whose types
depend on existing fields (e.g., adding laws to a record of operations)
is a difficult right-end access, as is suffix-truncation.

Sometimes we want to know that we are writing down a signature with a
fixed set of fields, and we want easy extensibility at the dependent
right end. That means \emph{left}-nested record types (also known as
\emph{contexts}). And that's where we need IR.

%format RecL = "\D{RecL}"
%format !>RL = !> "_{\!\F{RL}}"
%format <!_!>RL = <! _ !>RL
\begin{code}
mutual

  data RecL : Set1 where
    Em : RecL
    _::_ : {n : Nat}(R : RecL)(A : <! R !>RL -> Set)  -> RecL

  <!_!>RL : RecL -> Set
  <! Em !>RL      = One
  <! R :: A !>RL  = Sg <! R !>RL A
\end{code}

\begin{exe}[projection from |RecL|]
%format sizeRL = "\F{sizeRL}"
%format TyRL = "\F{TyRL}"
%format vaRL = "\F{vaRL}"
Show how to compute the size of a |RecL| without knowing the
individual record. Show how to interpret a projection as a
function from a record, first for types, then values.
\begin{spec}
sizeRL : RecL -> Nat
sizeRL R = ?

TyRL : (R : RecL) -> Fin (sizeRL R) -> <! R !>RL -> Set
TyRL R i = ?

vaRL : (R : RecL)(i : Fin (sizeRL R))(r : <! R !>RL) -> TyRL R i r
vaRL R i = ?
\end{spec}
%if False
\begin{code}
sizeRL : RecL -> Nat
sizeRL Em = zero
sizeRL (R :: A) = suc (sizeRL R)

TyRL : (R : RecL) -> Fin (sizeRL R) -> <! R !>RL -> Set
TyRL Em ()
TyRL (R :: A) zero = A o fst
TyRL (R :: A) (suc i) = TyRL R i o fst

vaRL : (R : RecL)(i : Fin (sizeRL R))(r : <! R !>RL) -> TyRL R i r
vaRL Em ()
vaRL (R :: A) zero = snd
vaRL (R :: A) (suc i) = vaRL R i o fst
\end{code}
%endif
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}[truncation]
Show how to truncate a record signature from a given field and compute the
corresponding projection on structures.
%format TruncRL = "\F{TruncRL}"
%format truncRL = "\F{truncRL}"
\begin{spec}
TruncRL : (R : RecL) -> Fin (sizeRL R) -> RecL
TruncRL R i = ?

truncRL : (R : RecL)(i : Fin (sizeRL R)) -> <! R !>RL -> <! TruncRL R i !>RL
truncRL R i = ?
\end{spec}
%if False
\begin{code}
TruncRL : (R : RecL) -> Fin (sizeRL R) -> RecL
TruncRL Em ()
TruncRL (R :: A) zero = R
TruncRL (R :: A) (suc i) = TruncRL R i

truncRL : (R : RecL)(i : Fin (sizeRL R)) -> <! R !>RL -> <! TruncRL R i !>RL
truncRL Em ()
truncRL (R :: A) zero = fst
truncRL (R :: A) (suc i) = truncRL R i o fst
\end{code}
%endif
\end{exe}


\subsection{Manifest Fields}

Pollack extends his notion of record with \emph{manifest fields}, i.e., fields
whose values are computed from earlier fields. It is rather like allowing
\emph{definitions} in contexts.

First, I define the type of data with a manifest value (sometimes also known
as \emph{singletons}). I deliberately keep the index right of the colon to
force Agda to store the singleton value in the data structure.
%format Manifest = "\D{Manifest}"
\nudge{Why is |Manifest| not an Agda record?}
\begin{code}
data Manifest {A : Set} : A -> Set where
  <$_$> : (a : A) -> Manifest a
\end{code}

%if False
\begin{code}
mproj : forall {A}{a : A} -> Manifest a -> A
mproj <$ a $> = a
\end{code}
%endif

Now, I extend the notion of record signature with a constructor for manifest
fields. I could have chosen simply to omit these fields from the record
structure, but instead I make them |Manifest| so that projection need not
involve recomputation. I also index by size, to save on measuring.
%format RecM = "\D{RecM}"
%format !>RM = !> "_{\!\F{RM}}"
%format <!_!>RM = <! _ !>RM
%format :<: = ::
%format :>: = "\C{\ni}"
%format _:<:_:>:_ = _ :<: _ :>: _
\begin{code}
mutual

  data RecM : Nat -> Set1 where
    Em         : RecM zero
    _::_       : {n : Nat}(R : RecM n)  (A : <! R !>RM -> Set) -> RecM (suc n)
    _:<:_:>:_  : {n : Nat}(R : RecM n)  (A : <! R !>RM -> Set)
                                        (a : (r : <! R !>RM) -> A r) -> RecM (suc n)

  <!_!>RM : {n : Nat} -> RecM n -> Set
  <! Em !>RM             = One
  <! R :: A !>RM         = Sg <! R !>RM A
  <! R :<: A :>: a !>RM  = Sg <! R !>RM (Manifest o a)
\end{code}

\begin{exe}[projection from |RecM|]
%format sizeRM = "\F{sizeRM}"
%format TyRM = "\F{TyRM}"
%format vaRM = "\F{vaRM}"
Implement projection for |RecM|.
\begin{spec}
TyRM : {n : Nat}(R : RecM n) -> Fin n -> <! R !>RM -> Set
TyRM R i = ?

vaRM : {n : Nat}(R : RecM n)(i : Fin n)(r : <! R !>RM) -> TyRM R i r
vaRM R i = ?
\end{spec}
Be careful not to recompute the value of a manifest field.
%if False
\begin{code}
TyRM : {n : Nat}(R : RecM n) -> Fin n -> <! R !>RM -> Set
TyRM Em ()
TyRM (R :: A) zero = A o fst
TyRM (R :: A) (suc i) = TyRM R i o fst
TyRM (R :<: A :>: _) zero = A o fst
TyRM (R :<: A :>: _) (suc i) = TyRM R i o fst

vaRM : {n : Nat}(R : RecM n)(i : Fin n)(r : <! R !>RM) -> TyRM R i r
vaRM Em () _
vaRM (R :: A) zero (r , a) = a
vaRM (R :: A) (suc i) (r , a) = vaRM R i r
vaRM (R :<: A :>: a) zero (r , m) = mproj m
vaRM (R :<: A :>: _) (suc i) (r , _)= vaRM R i r
\end{code}
%endif
\end{exe}
